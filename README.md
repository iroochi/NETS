# NETS - Extremely Fast Outlier Detection from a Data Stream via Set-Based Processing

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the **NETS algorithm**

A high-performance method for detecting outliers in streaming data using grid-based indexing and set-based processing. This project was inspired by the SIGMOD 2022 paper _"NETS: Extremely Fast Outlier Detection from a Data Stream via Set-Based Processing"_ [https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p1303-yoon.pdf].
