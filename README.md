# NETS - Extremely Fast Outlier Detection from a Data Stream via Set-Based Processing

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the **NETS algorithm**

A high-performance method for detecting outliers in streaming data using grid-based indexing and set-based processing. This project was inspired by the SIGMOD 2022 paper _"NETS: Extremely Fast Outlier Detection from a Data Stream via Set-Based Processing"_ [https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p1303-yoon.pdf].

## 1. About
In real-world streaming applications (fraud detection, sensor monitoring, etc.), **identifying anomalies quickly** is critical. However, traditional algorithms often suffer from high computation costs due to repetitive distance calculations.

**NETS (Net-Effect based Streaming)** solves this by:
- Using a **grid structure** to localize neighbor searches,
- Applying **set-based processing** to avoid recomputation,
- Leveraging **dimensional filtering** to focus on stable dimensions.

This project brings that algorithm to life in a clean, performant C++ implementation with a sliding window model.
